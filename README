Things to implement to practice:

* divide without / (DONE)
* fibonacci, iterative and recursive, try using tail recursion (DONE)
* Codility problem: given an array of ints, find the smallest index that makes a subset that includes all values in the array
* reverse a linked list
* different sorting algorithms
* do something with the time tracking file I'm keeping at work (DONE)
* benchmarking framework?
* logging framework
* HandlerSocket implementation

Things I Have Learned:
* Always explicitly declaring return value is a good pattern, even if it is unnecessary.
* Think about Options as a List that contains either one value (a Some) or no values (a None); then operate on Option using flatMap, filter, etc.
* Constructor arguments with no 'val' or 'var' declaration become private values.
