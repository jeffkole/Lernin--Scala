Things to implement to practice:

* divide without /
* fibonacci, iterative and recursive, try using tail recursion
* Codility problem: given an array of ints, find the smallest index that makes a subset that includes all values in the array
* reverse a linked list
* different sorting algorithms
* do something with the time tracking file I'm keeping at work
* benchmarking framework?
* logging framework
* HandlerSocket implementation
